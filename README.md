# OpenSCAD Project Library

This is my OpenScad project library. I generate a decent amount of code for 3D printing, from test projects to more large-scale projects like an open source quadruped (coming soon!) and wanted a structured way to store them.

## Works-In-Progress

Enter at your own risk. It is a bit of a hot mess right now.
